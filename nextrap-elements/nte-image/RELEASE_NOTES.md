### Added

- **Comprehensive Testing Infrastructure**: Complete testing suite for multiple instance functionality
    - **Test Dashboard** (`test-dashboard.html`) - Central navigation hub with test overview
    - **Multiple Instance Test** (`test-multiple-instances.html`) - Basic functionality verification
    - **Fullscreen Isolation Test** (`test-fullscreen-isolation.html`) - Fullscreen conflict testing
    - **Slideshow Independence Test** (`test-slideshow-independence.html`) - Slideshow conflict testing
    - **Performance & Memory Test** (`test-performance.html`) - Performance monitoring and stress testing

### Technical Details

- Each component instance now generates a unique ID using `nxa-image-{random}` format
- Fullscreen elements are now scoped with `data-instance` attributes
- Slideshow styles use instance-specific IDs to prevent conflicts
- All DOM queries for fullscreen elements now include instance filtering
- **Testing Infrastructure**: Professional-grade testing suite with real-time monitoring
- **Vite Integration**: Automatic dashboard opening when running `npm run dev`
- **Performance Metrics**: Real-time monitoring of memory usage, FPS, DOM nodes, and event listeners
- **Stress Testing**: Dynamic instance creation/destruction for performance validation
- **Memory Leak Detection**: Automated detection of potential memory issues
- **Console Integration**: Comprehensive logging and debugging support across all test scenarios

### Testing Workflow

The testing suite provides a structured approach to validating multiple instance functionality:

#### **Quick Start**

1. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server
2. Test dashboard automatically opens in browser
3. Navigate between different test scenarios
4. Monitor real-time performance metrics

#### **Test Scenarios**

- **Basic Functionality**: Verify multiple instances load without conflicts
- **Fullscreen Isolation**: Test multiple fullscreen views coexisting
- **Slideshow Independence**: Verify slideshows run at different speeds
- **Performance Under Load**: Monitor behavior with 20+ instances
- **Memory Management**: Detect potential memory leaks

#### **Expected Results**

- ✅ All instances load independently
- ✅ No style conflicts between instances
- ✅ Fullscreen views are completely isolated
- ✅ Slideshows run at different intervals
- ✅ Performance remains stable under load
- ✅ No memory leaks or resource conflicts

### Testing Infrastructure Technical Details

#### **Architecture**

- **Modular Design**: Each test file focuses on specific functionality
- **Consistent Navigation**: Unified navigation system across all tests
- **Responsive UI**: Mobile-friendly testing interface
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Live performance metrics and console output

#### **Performance Monitoring**

- **Memory Usage**: Simulated memory consumption tracking
- **FPS Monitoring**: Frame rate performance measurement
- **DOM Node Count**: Total DOM element tracking
- **Event Listener Count**: Active event handler monitoring
- **Interval Tracking**: Running slideshow timer count

#### **Stress Testing Capabilities**

- **Dynamic Instance Creation**: Programmatic instance generation
- **Load Testing**: Up to 20 simultaneous instances
- **Memory Leak Detection**: Automated resource monitoring
- **Performance Regression**: Baseline performance comparison
- **Data Export**: JSON export of performance metrics

#### **Development Experience**
