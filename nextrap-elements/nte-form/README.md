# nte-form

This library was generated with [Nx](https://nx.dev).

It provides form primitives for Nextrap projects:

- `nte-input`: general purpose form control wrapper.
- `nte-input-tags`: tag/autocomplete input.
- `nte-input-signature`: canvas-based signature capture.
- `nte-form-group`: layout helper for responsive form grids.

## Building

Run `nx build nte-form` to build the library.

## Running unit tests

Run `nx test nte-form` to execute the unit tests via [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/).

## Developing

Run `nx serve nte-form` to serve the `index.html` for development.
